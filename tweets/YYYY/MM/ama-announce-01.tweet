On Aug 23, 12:00 CEST we will have a community call "Ask Me Anything" about CodeRefinery. If you are interested in helping, teaching, hosting a CodeRefinery workshop, contributing to a lesson material, using GitLab service, etc., please save the date and time and join us! Connection details will be announced later.
